      <h2> Javascript</h2><br>
      <p>JavaScript® (often shortened to JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with first-class
        functions, and is best known as the scripting language for Web pages,but it's used in many non-browser
        environments
        as well. It is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm scripting language that is dynamic, and supports
        object-oriented,
        imperative, and functional programming styles.</p>
